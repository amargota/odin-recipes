    <h3>Pizza Sliders</h3>
   
    <p>These sliders really taste like pizza (as they should) but with a hint of sweetness from the Hawaiian rolls. Trying to separate them can get messy but they are absolutely delicious.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups (6 oz.) finely pre-shredded low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup (about 3 1/2 oz.) finely pre-shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups pizza sauce (from 1 [13-oz.] jar)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato pesto</li>
        <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian sweet rolls</li>
        <li>¾ cup (about 3 oz.) thinly sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment, and place a cooling rack on baking sheet. Spray rack with cooking spray.</p>

    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    <p>Stir together mozzarella, Italian cheese blend, basil, pepper, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Italian seasoning in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.</p>

    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    <p>Stir together pizza sauce and pesto in another small bowl. Set aside.</p>

    <strong>Step 4</strong>
    <p>Without separating the individual rolls, cut the entire slab of rolls in half horizontally using a serrated knife. Place bottom layer of rolls on the prepared baking sheet. Set top layer of rolls aside.</p>

    <strong>Step 5</strong>
    <p>Sprinkle bottom layer of rolls evenly with half of the cheese mixture; top evenly with half of pepperoni and half of the sauce. Repeat layers once.</p>

    <strong>Step 6</strong>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts, about 15 minutes.</p>

    <strong>Step 7</strong>
    <p>Meanwhile, combine butter, Parmesan, garlic powder, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning in a small saucepan; cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until butter melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside.</p>

    <strong>Step 8</strong>
    <p>Remove rolls from over, and add top layer of rolls; brush top of rolls evenly with butter mixture. Return to preheated oven, and bake until rolls are golden brown and crisp, about 5 mintues. Separate the rolls, and serve immediately.</p>
